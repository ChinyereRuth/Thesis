# 3.0 Results

## 3.1 Minimum Tempertaure 
Across Canada in the month of May, the minimum temperatures (Figure 5) before the fire varied from -8 to 20 degrees Celsius. Notably, the provinces of the Northwest Territories, Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Ontario exhibited high minimum temperature values exceeding 10 degrees Celsius, while locations such as Yukon experienced lower minimum temperatures.

```
## 3.2 Mean Tempertaure 
The mean temperature values, as depicted in Figure 5 for the month of May, closely paralleled the minimum temperature. Across lakes and rivers, the mean temperature values were lower. In contrast, regions such as the Northwest Territories, Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Ontario exhibited notably higher mean temperature values exceeding 20 degrees Celsius.

## 3.4 Prefire Tree Cover 
According to Figure X, regions surrounding the boreal forests exhibited elevated prefire tree cover. Specifically, the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia demonstrated higher pre-fire tree cover compared to other provinces in Canada, as illustrated in the figure. In contrast, the prefire tree cover in the vicinity of the unmanaged boreal forest was notably lower.

## 3.5 Mean Area burned

When the fire ignited in May, the Slave Lake region in the provinces of the Northwest Territories was affected. The extent of the burned area varied across the provinces in Canada, as depicted in Figure X. The severity of the burn was more pronounced in the provinces of Alberta, the Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan, where dNBR values higher than 0.5 were observed.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="40%", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Area burned in Canada  for the month of May, 2014"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/chinyereottah/Desktop/Mac/R_course/Assignment8/Thesis/img/Areaburned-Can-May2014.png")

```
In contrast, regions such as Ontario, British Columbia, and Yukon experienced lower burn severity during the month of May 2014. 


## Carbon emitted and variable of importance for predicting C emissions

Utilizing a Random Forest regression model with ranger for predicting carbon emissions across fires in Canada revealed that prefire tree cover, Landsat band 3, Landsat band 5, maximum temperature, and dNBR (difference Normalized Burn Ratio) emerged as the most influential variables in explaining carbon emissions within Canada's boreal forest (refer to Figure X). The model demonstrated a mean and explained 38% of the variance in combustion events.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Load required packages FOR RANGER RANDOM FOREST MODELLING
 #install.packages("ranger")
library(ranger)

# Load your data from Excel
Closs <- readxl::read_excel("/Users/chinyereottah/Desktop/Mac/R_course/Assignment8/Thesis/data/AGC-rangerforests-TC-Nov.xlsx")

# Split your data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility
sample_index <- sample(1:nrow(Closs), 0.7 * nrow(Closs))  # 70% for training

train_data <- Closs[sample_index, ]
test_data <- Closs[-sample_index, ]

# Specify the model
# Assuming 'AGC' is the dependent variable
# Adjust the formula according to your data frame structure
 formula <- AGC ~ B3 + B5 + B6 + Gness + Max_T + Mean_RH + Mean_T + dNBR + Canopcover + GDEM


# Train the Random Forest model with the 'importance' option
rf_model <- ranger(formula, data = train_data, importance = "impurity")

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions <- predict(rf_model, data = test_data)$predictions

# Evaluate the model for a continuous variable (e.g., Mean Absolute Error)
mae <- mean(abs(predictions - test_data$AGC))

cat("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", mae, "\n")

# Access feature importance values
feature_importance <- importance(rf_model)

# Print feature importance
print(feature_importance)

# Visualize feature importance using a bar plot


barplot(feature_importance, main = "Variable Importance", col = "skyblue", horiz = TRUE, cex.main = 1.2, cex.names = 0.9, cex.axis = 0.9)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions <- predict(rf_model, data = test_data)$predictions

# Calculate R-squared
correlation <- cor(predictions, test_data$AGC)
rsquared <- correlation^2

cat("R-squared:", rsquared, "\n")

```

The model had a  (MAE): 205.7412. Using this model output, C emitted across the 2023 fires will be predicted for Canada's forest.
